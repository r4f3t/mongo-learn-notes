# Schema Design and Design Patterns in MongoDB

MongoDB is known as a NoSQL database, and it has a different data model compared to traditional relational databases. Therefore, schema design in MongoDB requires different thinking and approaches than relational databases. In this article, we will focus on some fundamental design patterns used for schema design in MongoDB.

## 1. Flexible Schemas

MongoDB has a flexible document-based data model, meaning that data is not tightly bound to a specific schema. The document-based approach allows you to add and modify data flexibly according to the requirements of your application.

```javascript
// Sample Document
{
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: "Istanbul",
    country: "Turkey"
  }
}
```

## 2. Embedded Document Pattern

In MongoDB, the embedded document pattern involves having documents containing other documents. This pattern makes it easy to organize data and keep relationships within a document.

```javascript
// Sample User Document
{
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  address: {
    city: "Ankara",
    country: "Turkey"
  },
  orders: [
    { product: "Pen", quantity: 2 },
    { product: "Notebook", quantity: 1 }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Reference Pattern
In cases with large datasets or a significant amount of repeated data, the reference pattern can be useful. This pattern involves storing data in a separate collection and establishing connections through references.

```javascript
// User Document
{
  name: "Bob Smith",
  email: "bob@example.com",
  addressID: ObjectId("123456789012") // Reference to the address document
}

// Address Document
{
  _id: ObjectId("123456789012"),
  city: "Izmir",
  country: "Turkey"
}

```

These basic patterns are just a starting point for schema design in MongoDB. Depending on the needs of your application, more complex patterns and optimizations can be considered. MongoDB's flexible structure allows the use of various design patterns, making it adaptable to meet the specific requirements of each project.


# MongoDB Indexing, B-Tree, and the Explain Method

MongoDB is a favored NoSQL database, well-regarded for its effective indexing system to boost database performance. This article delves into MongoDB indexes, the B-Tree structure, efficient index creation methods, and the insights provided by the `explain` method.

## MongoDB Indexing

Indexes in MongoDB are pivotal for swiftly sorting and searching documents, utilizing the B-Tree (Binary Tree) structure for efficient data indexing.

### B-Tree Structure

B-Tree, a balanced tree structure, efficiently stores and retrieves sorted data. MongoDB indexes leverage this structure for effective data indexing.


### Efficient Index Creation Methods

1. **Indexing Based on Query Patterns:**
   - Creating indexes based on frequently used query patterns can significantly improve performance. Identifying which fields are often queried and indexing accordingly is fundamental.

2. **Ordered Indexing Considering Equality, Sorting, and Ranges:**
   - Defining the index order using equality, sorting, and range considerations optimizes the B-Tree structure. Left-to-right ordered indexes contribute to superior performance.

3. **Comprehensive and Reduced Indexes:**
   - Focusing indexes on commonly queried fields by creating comprehensive and reduced indexes optimizes both memory and disk usage.

## The `explain` Method and its Output

In MongoDB, the `explain` method is a powerful tool for evaluating and optimizing query performance. The output of this method provides insights into the query execution plan, used indexes, and performance statistics.

### How to Use `explain` Method as Code:

To use the `explain` method, append it to your query and provide "executionStats" as an argument to get detailed execution statistics. Here's an example:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ "username": "john" }).explain("executionStats");
```

### `queryPlanner`

- **plannerVersion:** Indicates the version of the query planning algorithm in use.

### `executionStats`

- **nReturned:** Specifies the number of documents returned by the query.
- **executionTimeMillis:** Represents the time taken for query execution in milliseconds.

### `winningPlan`

- **stage:** Specifies the stage in the query execution plan (e.g., "COLLSCAN" or "IXSCAN").
- **inputStage:** Contains detailed information, such as index usage, for the chosen plan.

### `inputStage`

- **stage:** Specifies the method used in this sub-stage (e.g., "IXSCAN" or "COLLSCAN").
- **keyPattern:** Specifies the key pattern of the used index.
- **indexName:** Specifies the name of the used index.
- **isMultiKey:** Indicates whether the index is multi-key.
- **isPartial:** Indicates whether the index is partial.
